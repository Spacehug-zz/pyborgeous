pyborgeous
==========
pyborgeous is an implementation of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel.

The library contains all the pages of all the books ever written,
the books being written, and the books that will be written in the future.




**Example**:

``pyborgeous -m unicode -s 'The first colony on Mars was founded in 2027.'``

**Produces address**:


``<Really long string of symbols>       2       0       22      152``


Which means the page with this text: "The first colony on Mars was founded in 2027." is in that room (long address)
3rd bookcase, 1st shelf from the top, 23th book from the left, on the page number 153.
